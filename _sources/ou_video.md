# Embedded video â€” `ou-video` admonition

Embed a video player capable of playing of a specified video file:

````text
```{ou-video} resources/test.mp4
A caption for a video file.

A line of description.
And continuation of the line.

More description.
```
````

```{ou-video} resources/test.mp4
A caption for a video file.

A line of description.
And continuation of the line.

More description.
```

Renders to the following OU-XML:

```xml
<MediaContent type="video" height="" width="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/innovationoutside/sphinxcontrib-ou-xml-tags/main/vletmp/ouseful-demo-sphinx_b0_p1_x_media_test.mp4">
    <Caption>Figure 2.1 A caption for a video file.</Caption>
    <Description>
        <Paragraph>A line of description.
            And continuation of the line.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>More description.</Paragraph>
    </Description>
</MediaContent>
```

The block can also be empty of caption and description text. *If there is any text in the body of the admonition, the first line is mapped onto an OU-XML `<Caption>` element.*

The MyST spec also lets you use a video file path in a `{figure}` admonition when generating HTML output, but this is not support for conversion to OU-XML. There is a also a [`sphinx-contrib/youtube`](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/youtube) extension for embedding videos, but again there is no direct path for generating an appropriate OU-XML media tag.

*TO DO: how does OU-XML recommend YouTube embeds?*
